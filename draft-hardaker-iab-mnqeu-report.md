# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The Measuring Network Quality for End-Users workshop was held
virtually by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in September, 2021.
This workshop summarizes the workshop, the topics discussed and some
preliminary conclusions drawn at the end of the workshop. 

## Problem space

The Internet in 2021 is quite different from what it was 10 years
ago. Today, it is a crucial part of everyone’s daily life. People use
the Internet for their social life, for their daily jobs, for routine
shopping, and for keeping up with major events. An increasing number
of people can access a Gigabit connection, which would be hard to
imagine a decade ago. And, thanks to improvements in security, people
trust the Internet for both planning their finances and for everyday
payments.

At the same time, some aspects of end-user experience have not
improved as much. Many users have typical connection latency that
remains at decade-old levels. Despite significant reliability
improvements in data center environments, end users often see
interruptions in service. Despite algorithmic advances in the field of
control theory, one can often find that the queuing delay in the
last-mile equipment exceeds the accumulted transit delay. Transport
improvements, such as QUIC, Multipath TCP, and TCP Fast Open are still
not fully supported in some networks. Likewise, various advances in
the security and privacy of user data are not widely supported, such
as encrypted DNS to the local resolver.

Some of the major factors behind this lack of progress is the popular
perception that throughput is the often sole measure of the quality of
Internet connectivity. With such narrow focus, the workshop aimed to
discuss various questions:

- What is the latency under typical working conditions?
- How reliable is the connectivity across longer time periods?
- Does the network allow the use of a broad range of protocols?
- What services can be run by clients of the network?
- What kind of IPv4, NAT or IPv6 connectivity is offered, and are
  there firewalls?
- What security mechanisms are available for local services, such as
  DNS?
- To what degree are the privacy, confidentiality, integrity and
  authenticity of user communications guarded?
- Improving these aspects of network quality will likely depend on
  measurement and exposing metrics to all involved parties, including
  to end users in a meaningful way. Such measurements and exposure of
  the right metrics will allow service providers and network operators
  to focus on the aspects that impacts the users’ experience most and
  at the same time empowers users to choose the Internet service that
  will give them the best experience.
- What are the fundamental properties of a network that contribute to good user experience?
- What metrics quantify these properties, and how to collect such metrics in a practical way?
- What are the best practices for interpreting those metrics, and incorporating those in a decision making process?
- What are the best ways to communicate these properties to service providers and network operators?
- How can these metrics be displayed to users in a meaningful way?

# Discussions

The three day workshop was broken into four separate sections,
including introductory material and conclusions, that each played a
role in framing the discussions.

## Introduction and overviews

The Introduction section allowed participants to introduce and discuss
the problem space, existing mechanisms for QoS and QoE measurements.
Also discussed was the interaction between multiple users within the
Network, as well as the interaction between multiple layers of the OSI
stack.  Some existing measurement works were presented.  Vint Cerf
provided a key note support describing the history and importance of
the topic.

## Metrics considerations

The Metrics section of the workshop concentrated on both defining new
and existing measures and how they might apply to different sections
of the Internet.  The need for improvements to latency and its
measurements was heavily discussed, especially for certain classes of
users such as live, collaborative content and gaming.

## Cross-layer considerations

In the Cross-layer section participants present material and discussed
how accurately measuring exactly where problems occur is difficult
when many components of a network connection can affect the
measurement.  Discussion centered especially on the differences
between physically wired and wireless connections and the difficulties
of accurately determining problem spots when multiple different
network types are responsible the quality.

## Synthesis

Finally, in the Synthesis section presentations and discussions
concentrated on the next steps likely needed to make forward
progress. Of particular concern is how to bring forward measurements
that can make sense to end users trying to make subscription
decisions.

# Conclusions

During the final hour of the workshop we gathered statements that
group thought were summary statements from the 3 day event.  We later
discarded any that were in contention (listed further below for
completeness).  For this document, the editor took the original list
and divided it into rough categories, applied some suggested edits
discussed on the mailing list and further edited for clarity and to
provide context.

## General statements

1. Bandwidth is necessary but not alone sufficient
2. In many cases, Internet users don’t need more bandwidth, but rather
   need "better bandwidth" -- i.e., they need other improvements to
   their connectivity.
3. We need both active and passive measurements – passive measurements
   can provide historical debugging.
4. We need passive measurements to be continuous and archivable and
   queriable – include reliability/connectivity measurements.
5. A really meaningful metric for users is whether their application
   will work properly or fail because of a lack of a network with
   sufficient characteristics.
6. An useful metric for goodness must actually incentive goodness --
   good metrics should actionable to help drive industries toward
   improvement.
7. A lower latency internet, however achieved would benefit all end
   users.

## Specific statements about detailed protocols/techniques

8. Round trips Per Minute (RPM) is a useful, consumable metric
9. We need a usable tool that fills the current gap between network
   reachability, latency and speed tests.
10. End-users that want to be involved in QoS decisions should be able
    to voice their needs and desires.
11. Applications are needed that can perform and report good quality
    measurements in order to identify insufficient points in 
    network access.
12. Research done by regulators indicate that users/consumers prefer
    a simple metric per application, which frequently resolves to
    whether the application will work properly not.
13. New measurements and QoS or QoE techniques should not rely only or
    depend on reading TCP headers.
10. It is clear from developers of interactive applications and from
    network operators that lower latency is a strong factor in user
    QoE.  However, metrics are lacking to support this statement
    directly.

## Problem statements and concerns

15. Latency mean and medians are distractions from better measurements
16. It is frustrating to only measure network services without
    simultaneously improving those services
17. Stakeholder incentives aren’t aligned for easy wins in this space.
    Incentives are needed to motivate improvements in public network
    access.  Measurements may be one step toward driving competitive
    market incentive.
18. For future-proof networking, measuring ecological impact of
    measuring material and energy usage is important.
19. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that any one metric
    (e.g. latency or speed) is more important than others to persuade
    device vendors to concentrate on any one optimization.

## No-consensus reached statements

Additional statements were recorded that did not have consensus of the
group at the time, but we list here for completeness about the fact
they were discussed:

1. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that buffer bloat is a
   prevalent problem
2. The measurement needs to support reporting localization in order to
   find problems.  Specifically:
    - Detecting a problem is not sufficient if you can’t find the location
    - Need more than just english – different localization concerns
3. Stakeholder incentives aren’t aligned for easy wins in this space

# Follow on work

There was discussion during the workshop about where future work
should be performed.  The group agreed that some work could be done
more immediately within existing IETF working groups, while other
longer-term research may be needed in IRTF groups.

# Security considerations

A few security relevant topics were discussed at the workshop,
including but not limited to:

- What prioritization techniques can work without invading the privacy
  of the communicating parties.
- How oversubscribed networks can essentially be viewed as a DDoS
  attack.
